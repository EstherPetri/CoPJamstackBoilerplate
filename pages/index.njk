            <p>If you followed all steps on the right, it's time to see if your dynamic content got loaded as anticipated.

            <p>If you don't see your content: Go to your Contentful webhook and Netlify Build hook logs to see if it fired and triggered correctly. Additional logging there will help!</p>

                <li class="list-group-item">2. In <span class="badge badge-secondary">Content model</span>, add a content type called 'card' with a short text 'Title' (being the entry title), rich text 'Description' and short text 'Gif URL'.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">3. In <span class="badge badge-secondary">Content</span>, add some 'card' entries, fill them with some mock content.<br/><span class="text-muted">(hint: <a href="https://giphy.com/">Giphy</a> has a lot of GIFs!)</span></li>
                <li class="list-group-item">4.

                <li class="list-group-item">5. A local <span class="badge badge-warning">npm run data</span> will now retrieve the data from Contentful, and <span class="badge badge-warning">npm run build</span>, incorporates both 11ty as gathering the data, will make it a working package!</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">6. To make it work only, go to <a href="https://app.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and head over to <span class="badge badge-secondary">Site settings > Build & Deploy > Continuous Deployment</span> and change the publish directory from <span class="badge badge-info">demo</span> to <span class="badge badge-info">dist</span>. Also add <span class="badge badge-warning">npm run build</span> as the build command.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">7. While there, scroll down to <span class="badge badge-secondary">Build hooks</span>, add one, give it a name you like and keep the branch on 'master'. Save it and copy the <span class="badge badge-primary">Build hook URL</span>.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">8. Now we head back to <a href="https://www.contentful.com/">Contentful</a> and navigate to <span class="badge badge-secondary">Settings > Webhooks</span>. Press on the 'Add webhook' button on the right top.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">9. In the next screen, name the webhook whatever you'd like and paste the copied <span class="badge badge-primary">Build hook URL</span> from Netlify behind the 'Post' dropdown. Keep the radio buttons below as is and save afterwards.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item">10. All should be working now! üèÅ  Whenever you publish a 'card' in Contentful, this should trigger a new build with therefore new data on Netlify!</li>
